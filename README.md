## Usage

FIXME

## Performance

FIXME

Probably terrible, although I'm not yet sure what the bottleneck is going to be: Drawing the polygon or evaluating the penalty amount?

## TODOs

* EVERYTHING

## NOTDOs

Here are some things this project will definitely not support:
* Disconnected landmasses
* Completely different approaches (do them as a final pass or something)
